Build a production-style ELT pipeline that scrapes Ethiopian medical-business Telegram channels, lands the raw JSON in a data-lake folder structure, loads it into PostgreSQL, cleans and models it into a star-schema with dbt, enriches images via YOLO v8 object detection, and exposes analytical endpoints with FastAPI.
